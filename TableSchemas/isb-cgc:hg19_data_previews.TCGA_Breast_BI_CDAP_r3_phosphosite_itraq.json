CPTAC iTRAQ phosphopeptide quantitations for a set of breast cancer samples are made available in this table. The samples are identified using the same TCGA barcodes that are used in other available TCGA tables in BigQuery, allowing for convenient integrative analyses. More details: A publication describing this data and associated findings was published in  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27251275",

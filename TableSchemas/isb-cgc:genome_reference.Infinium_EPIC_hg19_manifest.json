The data is based on the file http://zwdzwd.io/InfiniumAnnotation/20180909/EPIC/EPIC.hg19.manifest.tsv.gz Note that column \"gene_HGNC\", which in the original table contains a semi-colon delimited string, has been denormalized in this table, so that each row includes a reference to only one gene, and methylation probes that are in/near multiple genes will have some information repeated on multiple rows.
